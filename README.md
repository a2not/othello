# Othello
## Othello with a minimax based opponent.

### Description
Implementation of othello vs minimax based AI opponent.

### Instructions to Play
To play othello, run it in any Python 3.x interpreter.

You will be presented with an 8x8 grid on the screen with a 2x2 square of alternating tiles in the middle as described above. There will be a scoreboard in the bottom section of the screen to keep track of your score (how many tiles of your colour) and to indicate whose turn it is.

When it is your turn, you'll see green dots showing all of your valid moves. Clicking one of these dots will make a move and it will now be the computer's turn.

If you wish to restart or create a new game, you may press the "Restart" button in the top left of the screen. To quit, you may press the "Quit" button in the top right of the screen.

### TO DO:
- Good win/loss indicator

### DONE:
- Better AI (minimax with alpha beta pruning is end-goal)
- Player turn indicator
- Restart/Quit GUI
- Animation for changing tiles
